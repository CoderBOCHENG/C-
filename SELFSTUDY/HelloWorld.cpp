// Defination of computer - A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. 

//the device infront of u is called hardware in the computer world because it can be seen and touched

// computers can be made to do a lot of objects such as robot programming, online games, planes, and phone, and movies.

// a computer is not a computer if it only has hardware we have to program the computer if we wants it to do something. the computer language is used to program. language is a complex communication system, and its purpose is for communication. A computer language is a method of communication with a computer.

// history of computer language: original pc language, binary digit '0000 0000 0000000 10000' <--> 'LOAD A, 16' it means put (load) 16 into Register A

// Assemble Language 'mov ax,bx' means '1000 100111 011000' Structured program language are pascal, c, etc. Object-oriented program language: c++, java, python, etc.

#INCLUDE<IOSTREAM>
1. syntax format
#include<>
2. Role
add a header file
there are many functions/class defined in C++ that we cn use directly. We must import the function or class we need into the program in advance through the header file, otherwise we cannot use them, if we do, error will be reported when we run the program




USING NAMESPACE STD;

1. syntax format
fixed format. just copy the code

2.role
use a namespace
ensure that cin,cout and other C++ standard commands can be used.
if unused, error will be reported when we compile the program



INT MAIN()

1. role
define the main function
it is used to implement the main program

2. attention
the end of parentheses does not need ";"
